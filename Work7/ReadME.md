Problem1:In this problem, you will implement a light dimmer with a potentiometer.

-Connect a pot using a resistor divider setting.

-Connect two external LEDs. These LEDs will light up in opposite configuration.

-By changing the pot you will change the brightness of these LEDs. For example if the pot is all they way down,
first LED should light up, and second LED should be o, and if the pot is all the way up, first LED should be o
and the second LED should light up. Their brightness should change in between.

-You will need PWM for the LED driving to change the brightness. 0 duty cycle will turn o the LEDs and 100%
duty cycle will light them up completely

Problem2:
